> "The motif of the labyrinth has a long history. Depictions in rock art may date back as far as 10,500-4800 BCE,
> and can be found from Nevada to Cornwall, from Lancashire to Spain. The purpose of the image is unclear, but 
> they all share the same form â€“ a unicursal, meandering symbol, turning and changing directions from outside to
> the centre but never crossing itself. But by far the most famous labyrinth of all is that of ancient Crete"
